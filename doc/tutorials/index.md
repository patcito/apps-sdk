There are a lot of tools to help make building apps easier. To help familiarize
yourself with some of the things that the tools can help with, here are some
places to start:

- [Content Catalog](media_downloader.html)

  A simple app that takes a remote resource containing some metadata and
  displays it to the user so they can easily download new torrents.

- [Permissions](permissions_tutorial.html)

  A more advanced tutorial, for apps that need access to all of the torrents
  being downloaded by a client.

- [Internationalization](i18n_tutorial.html)

  Lots of &micro;Torrent users use languages other than english. This tutorial
  shows you how to make your app localizable.

All tutorials also come with completed example applications. If you'd like to
take a look at any of these, check out the [Examples
Directory](../../examples/).
