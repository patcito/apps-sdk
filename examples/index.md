Check out some of the example apps that are available:

- [Media Downloader](https://github.com/bittorrent/apps-sdk/tree/master/examples/media_downloader/)

  A simple app that takes a remote resource containing some metadata and
  displays it to the user so they can easily download and play new
  torrents. Note that you can check out a tutorial on how to actually build
  this app yourself at [Media Downloader
  Tutorial](../doc/tutorials/media_downloader.html).

- [Permissions](https://github.com/bittorrent/apps-sdk/tree/master/examples/permissions/)

  Normally, apps are sandboxed so that they can only see the torrents they've
  added. This example shows how to elevate your app's permissions so that it
  can see all the torrents a user is downloading. There is a tutorial for this
  app as well that you can see at [Permissions
  Tutorial](../doc/tutorials/permissions_tutorial.html).

- [Internationalization](https://github.com/bittorrent/apps-sdk/tree/master/examples/media_downloader_i18n/)

  &micro;Torrent users are all over the world. To make your app readable in as
  many languages as possible, take a look at this example. For a tutorial on
  exactly how to build this app, check out [Internationalization
  Tutorial](../doc/tutorials/i18n_tutorial.html).

- [RSS Feeds](https://github.com/bittorrent/apps-sdk/tree/master/examples/linux_tracker/)

  Not only can apps add torrents to the &micro;Torrent client, they can also
  add RSS Feeds. This example shows how to add an RSS Feed to the client and
  then use that feed to display a user friendly list of what's going on. For a
  tutorial, check out [RSS Feeds Tutorial](../doc/tutorials/feeds.html).

- [Vodo](https://github.com/bittorrent/apps-sdk/tree/master/examples/vodo/)

  A polished, fully featured version of the media downloader tutorial. Take a
  look if you'd like to see how to do some more advanced things once you've
  finished the media downloader tutorial.
